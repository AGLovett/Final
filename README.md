# For my final I wanted to create a tool that would help me personally. 
 When I'm modeling in maya I often forget to do the scene cleanup parts of the project like freezing transformations, deleteing
 history, and going through and finding empty nodes.
 With this tool you're able to do all those things and add suffixes to you objects in one simple UI!
 I spent a lot of time on this and I hope it helps other 3D artist as much as I think it's going to help me!
